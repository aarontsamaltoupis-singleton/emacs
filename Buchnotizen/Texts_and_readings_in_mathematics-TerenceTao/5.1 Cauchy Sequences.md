# Definition 5.1.1 (Sequences)
A sequence $(a_{n})^{\infty}_{n=m}$ of *rational numbers* is any [[Funktionen|function]] from the set $\{ n\in \mathbb{Z}: n\geq m\}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$


# Definition 5.1.3 (epsilon steadiness)
Let $\varepsilon>0$.

# Definition 5.1.8 (Cauchy sequences)
A sequence of rational numbers is a cauchy sequence iff for every rational $\varepsilon>0$ it is eventually $\varepsilon$-steady.

# Definiton 5.1.12 (Bounded sequence)
Let $M\geq{0}$ be rational. A finite sequence $a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}$ is *bounded by M* iff $|a_{i}|\leq M$, forall $1\leq i\leq n$.

An infinite sequence $(a_{n})^{\infty}_{n=1}$ is bounded by M iff $|a_{i}|\leq M, \forall i\geq{1}$.

# Lemma 5.1.14 (Finite sequences are bounded)
Every finite Sequence is bounded.
