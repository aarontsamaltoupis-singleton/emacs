**Exercise 5.3.3**
Let $a,b$ be rational numbers. Show that a=b iff $LIM_{n\to \infty}a = LIM \ b$
(The cauchy sequences a,a,a,a,... and b,b,... iff a=b) 

**5.3.4**
Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence of rational numbers which is [[5.1 Cauchy Sequences|bounded ]].
Let $b_{n}$ be another sequence of rational number which is equivalent to $a_{n}$.
Show that $b_{n}$ is also bounded.
Hint: [[Exercise 5.2#5.2.2]]


**5.3.5**
show that $LIM_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n}=0$
