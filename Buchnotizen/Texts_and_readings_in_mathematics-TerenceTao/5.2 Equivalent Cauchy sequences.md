# Definition 5.2.1 (epsilon -close sequences)
Let $(a_{n})^{\infty}_{n=0}$ and $(b_{n})^{\infty}_{n=0}$ be two sequences and let $\varepsilon>0$
They are $\varepsilon-close$ iff $a_{n}$ is [[4.3 Absolute value and exponentiation#epsilon closeness|epsilon-close]] to $b_{n}$ for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$.

# Defintion 5.2.3 (eventually epsilon-close sequences)

# Definition 5.2.6 (Equivalent sequences)
Two sequences are equivalent iff for each rational $\varepsilon>0$ the sequences are eventually $\varepsilon$-close.
