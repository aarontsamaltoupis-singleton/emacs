graph: collection of vertices and edges

If two vertices are connected by an edge, they are called **adjacent** or **neighbours**

By convention Graphs do not contain multiple edges or loops.
If multiple edges or loops are used we use the term **pseudograph**

# Terms
## walk
A walk starts with a vertex and ends with a vertex, where one can only ttravel from a vertex to an adjacent vertex

## degree
- number of edges emanating from a particular vertex


# Connected Graph
- for every **pair of vertices** there is a [[#walk]] from one to the other


# Handshake Lemma
In any Graph ,the sum of the degrees of all the vertices is equal to twice the number of edges:
