# Def 5.3.1: Real numbers
A real number is defined to be an object of the for $LIM_{n\to \infty}a_{n}$, where $(a_{n})^{\infty}_{n=1}$ is a [[5.1 Cauchy Sequences|Cauchy sequence]]  of rational numbers.
Two real numbers $LIM_{n\to \infty}a_{n}$ and $LIM_{n\to \infty}b_{n}$ are said to be equal iff $(a_{n})^{\infty}_{n=1}$ and $(b_{n})^{\infty}_{n=1}$ are [[5.2 Equivalent Cauchy sequences#Definition 5.2.6 (Equivalent sequences)|equivalent]].

# reciprocation of the real numbers

# Def 5.3.12 (Sequences bounded away from zero)
a [[5.1 Cauchy Sequences#Definition 5.1.1 (Sequences)|sequence]]$(a_{n})_{n}$ is bounded away from zero iff $\exists c>0: |a_{n}|\geq c,\forall n\geq{1}$
Bsp: $(0,0.9,0.99,\dots)$ is not bounded away from zero, as $0 \not> 0$
# Lemma 5.3.12
Every non-zero real number is the formal limit of a cauchy sequence bounded away from zero:

Let x be a non-zero real number. Then $x=LIM_{n\to \infty}a_{n}$ for some Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})_{n}$ which is bounded away from zero.


# Lemma 5.3.15 
Suppose that $(a_{n})n$ is a [[5.1 Cauchy Sequences#Definition 5.1.8 (Cauchy sequences)|Cauchy Sequence]] which is [[#Def 5.3.12 (Sequences bounded away from zero)|bounded away from zero]]. Then the sequence $(a_{n}^{-1})_{n}$ is also a Cauchy sequence.


# Definition 5.3.16 (Reciprocals of real numbers)
Let x be a non-zero real number. 
Let $(a_{n})_{n}$ be a [[5.1 Cauchy Sequences#Definition 5.1.8 (Cauchy sequences)|Cauchy sequence]] bouded away from zero such that $x=LIM_{n\to \infty}a_{n}$.
Then we define the reciprocal $x^{-1}$ by the formal $x^{-1}:=LIM_{n\to \infty}a_{n}^{-1}$.
