# Definition 5.1.1 (Sequences)
A sequence $(a_{n})^{\infty}_{n=m}$ of *rational numbers* is any [[Funktionen|function]] from the set $\{ n\in \mathbb{Z}: n\geq m\}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$


# Definition 5.1.3 (epsilon steadiness)
Let $\varepsilon>0$.


# Definition 5.1.8 (Cauchy sequences)
A sequence of rational numbers is a cauchy sequence iff for every rational $\varepsilon>0$ it is eventually $\varepsilon$-steady.

# Definiton 5.1.12 (Bounded sequence)
Let $M\geq{0}$ be rational. A finite sequence $a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}$ is *bounded by M* iff $|a_{i}|\leq M$, forall $1\leq i\leq n$.

An infinite sequence $(a_{n})^{\infty}_{n=1}$ is bounded by M iff $|a_{i}|\leq M, \forall i\geq{1}$.


# Definition 5.2.1 (epsilon -close sequences)
Let $(a_{n})^{\infty}_{n=0}$ and $(b_{n})^{\infty}_{n=0}$ be two sequences and let $\varepsilon>0$
They are $\varepsilon-close$ iff $a_{n}$ is [[Absolut value and exponentiation#epsilon closeness|epsilon-close]] to $b_{n}$ for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$.

# Defintion 5.2.3 (eventually epsilon-close sequences)

# Definition 5.2.6 (Equivalent sequences)
Two sequences are equivalent iff for each rational $\varepsilon>0$ the sequences are eventually $\varepsilon$-close.
