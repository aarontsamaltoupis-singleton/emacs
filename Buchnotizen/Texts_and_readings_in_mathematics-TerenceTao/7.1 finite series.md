# definition 7.1.6 Summations over finite sets

Let X be a finite set with n elements (where n ∈ N), and let f : X → R be a function from X

to the real numbers (i.e., f assigns a real number f (x) to each element x
of X). Then we can define the finite sum $\sum_{x\in X}^{}f(x)$ as follows. We first select any bijection g from {i ∈ N : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} to X; such a bijection
exists since X is assumed to have n elements. We then define $$
    \sum_{x\in X}^{ }f(x):=\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(g(i))
$$
