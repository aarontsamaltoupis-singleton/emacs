# Proposition 2.1.16
Suppose for each natural number n, there is a function $f_{n}:N\to N$
and
Suppose $c\in N$

It is possible to assign each natural number $n$ to a  natural number $a_{n}$,
such that $a_{0}=c$  and $a_{n++}=f_{n}(a_{n})$
	bsp: to the number 1 the unique natural number $a_{1}=f_{0}(a_{0})$ is assigned

# Proof by [[The Peano axioms#Axiom 2.5 (principle of mathematical Induction)|Induction]]
$a_{0}=c$


The proof uses all [[The Peano axioms|axioms]].
