# Definition 4.3.1 (Absolute Value)
If x is a rationa. numberr, the absolute value |x| of x is defined as follows.
If x is positive, the |x|:=x
If x is negative, then |x|:=-x
if x is zero, then |x|:=0

# Def 4.3.2 (Distance)

# Prop 4.3.3 (Basic properties of absolute value and distance)

# Def 4.3.4 epsilon closeness
let $\varepsilon>0$ be a rational nnumber and let $x,y$ be rational numbers. We say that y is $\varepsilon-close$ to x iff we have $d(x,y)\leq\varepsilon$.

# Prop 4.3.7
