A Vector space $V$ is a collection of objects, called vectors alsong with two  operations: addition of vectors and multiplication by a number(scalar) such that the following $\hspace{0pt}8$ properties (the *axioms* of a vector space) hold:

The first $\hspace{0pt}4$ properties deal with addition: 
$\hspace{0pt}1$. Commutativity: $\forall v,w\in V: v+w=w+v$
$\hspace{0pt}2$. Associativity: $\forall u,v,w\in V:(u+v)+w = u+(v+w)$
$\hspace{0pt}3$. Zero vector: there exists a special vector, denoted by $\hspace{0pt}0$ such that $\forall v\in V:v+0=v$
$\hspace{0pt}4$. Additive inverse: $\forall v\in V : \exists w\in V(v+w=0)$. The additive inverse is usually denoted as $-v$.

The next $\hspace{0pt}2$ deal with multiplication: 



If the scalars are the real numbers the space $V$ is **a real vector space**.
If the scalars are the complex numbers $V$ is a **complex vector space**.

Suppose the scalars are elements of an arbitrary [[Körper|field]] $\mathbb{F}$. $V$ is a vector space **over the field $\mathbb{F}$.
