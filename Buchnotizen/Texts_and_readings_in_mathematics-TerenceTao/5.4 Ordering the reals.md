# Def 5.4.1 
Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence of rationals.
We say that this sequence is **positively** [[5.3 the construction of the Real numbers|bounded away from zero]] iff we have a positive rational $c>0$ such that $a_{n}\geq c, \forall n\geq1$
--> In particular: The  sequence is  entirely positive
--> The sequence is bounded away fom zero, a [[5.3 the construction of the Real numbers|reciprocal]] is defined

# Def 5.4.3 
A real number x is positive iff it can be written as $x=LIM \ a_{n}$ for some Cauchy sequence $a_{n}$ which is positively bounded away from zero.

# Proposition 5.4.4 (Basic properties of positive reals)
For every real number x, exactly one of the following statements is true: 

- x is zero
- x is positive 
- x is negative

x is negative iff -x is positive
x and y positive --> x+y, xy positive
